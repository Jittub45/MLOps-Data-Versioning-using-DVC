1.Create git repo and clone it in local 
2.Create myCode.py and add code to it.(It will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3.Do a git add-commit-push before initilazing dvc.
    #pip install dvc
4.Now we do "dvc init"(Creates .divignore, .dvc)
5.Making a folder for dvc to store the version("mkdir s3")
6.Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote s3"
7.Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git comnit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8.Again we do "dvc add data/"(creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9.Now- "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10.Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11.Now make changes to myCode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12.Again dvc - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
